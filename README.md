# Projeto RMIC
This project consists of an Android App. It was developed on Android Studio Meerkat v21.0.5.

It allows remote monitoring of a thermal camera and luminosity sensor (in this case the BH1750 luminosity sensor and IR Grid Click 3 sensor were used).
The sensors collect the data and send it to a firebase databse.
The app then reads these values from the firebase database and displays an improved thermal image of the data collected as well as visual indicators (temperature, illuminance and time).
